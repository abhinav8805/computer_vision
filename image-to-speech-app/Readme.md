# ðŸ“¸ Image to Speech App

This project uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from an uploaded image and then reads the text aloud using Text-to-Speech (TTS).

The application is structured with a Python/Flask backend for the image processing and a React frontend for the user interface.
